You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size Q×2.

Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].

For every query, your task is to find the count of even numbers in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].

Input
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
3
B = [   [0, 2] 
        [2, 4]
        [1, 4]   ]

Output
[1,1,2]

Input
A = [2, 1, 8, 3, 9, 6]
4
B = [   [0, 3]
        [3, 5]
        [1, 3]
        [2, 4]    ]

Output
[2,1,1,1]
